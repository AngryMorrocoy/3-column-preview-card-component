# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend
Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-).

## My way

Didn't found this challenge incredibly hard, but I had fun while coding it, I
decided not to use any framework or preprocesor due to the simplicity of the
design. I think it would be an overkill for this project.
